From the [homepage]() of the event:

„Contributing to the world’s to do list“ is a quote from António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, on the occasion of the opening of the 77th UN General Assembly (UNGA77) in September 2022. It is the motto of the current call for a wide variety of campaigns in support of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals). In order to support excellent doctoral candidates at Heidelberg University, the Stadt-Heidelberg-Stiftung (Heidelberg City Foundation) awards biannual funding for the organization of two lecture series by doctoral candidates, each focusing on one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. The framework of the event is based on the content of one of the 17 goals, so that originality and diversity are guaranteed in terms of the choice of topics, research approaches and diversity of subjects.
